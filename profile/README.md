## 🔮 What Are Mage Arena Mods?

Mods are script-based or injected add-ons that tweak the way Mage Arena works – from **game-breaking spell power** to custom UI features and mechanics. They don’t just make you stronger—they make the entire game *feel different*. From easy farming to trolling mobs with freeze hacks, mods let you play your way.

And yeah… you can still go full chaos with one-hit spells and god mode if that’s your style 😈
